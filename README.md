<h3 align="center">Welcome to this repository! ðŸŽ‰</h3> 
This project contains a well-documented and detailed Python codebase focused on various tools and techniques for data preprocessing. Whether you're cleaning, transforming, or preparing your dataset for analysis or machine learning, you'll find useful snippets and explanations here to help you along the way.
# Data Preprocessing Tools in Python

## How to Use

1. **Explore the Code**: The code is structured and commented to be easy to understand. Each preprocessing step is explained in detail, so you can follow along and learn how to apply these techniques to your own data.

2. **Customize for Your Dataset**: The only modification you need to make is to replace the dataset name in the code with the name of your own dataset. This allows you to apply these preprocessing techniques directly to your data.

    ```python
    # Example: Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the name of your dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
    ```

3. **Get Started**: After updating the dataset name, you can run the code in your local environment or in Google Colab to see the preprocessing in action!

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
